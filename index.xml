      <description>I started this project while working on the Southampton university cipher challenge as I wanted an easy way of testing words my team and I thought were likely to be the passphrases, also I wanted the ability to leave this running over long periods of time in an attempt to brute force it by using a dictionary attack.
The initial cipher text is decoded with a passphrase, either from a file of words (such as a dictionary) or from a predefined function, such as trying all possible words of length 6.</description>
